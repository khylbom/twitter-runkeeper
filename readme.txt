3. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
        None


4. Did you add any bonus features to your submission? If so, what are they and how should we see them?
        When live button is pressed from descriptions.html, the results are automatically displayed
        for the new set of tweet data for the search in the user input field.

        Saved and live tweets are only loaded once. This improves the responsiveness considerably!

5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
        The twitter proxy needs to be running in order for the live tweets to be fetched from the
        twitter API. In other words, the code does not launch the proxy automatically.
            From inside root directory, run:
                twitter-proxy twitter_proxy_config.json
        At this time, we will assume that the user already has installed twitter-proxy and is
        supplying their own twitter_proxy_config.json with the consumerKey and consumerSecret.
